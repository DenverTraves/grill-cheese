        <h2>Note:</h2>
        <p>Grilled cheese is great on a grill, but for a quicker method, try using a clamshell panini press. The result will be much quicker, allowing you to make many more for you and your friends.</p>
    <p>Remember, Shaun says "Grilled cheese sandwiches are a staple of the North American diet!".</p>
